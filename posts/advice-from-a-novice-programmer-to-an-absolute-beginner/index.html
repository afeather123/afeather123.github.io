<p>A few weeks ago, I attended a talk from a Google employee who gave advice about working in the software industry, sharing his perspective on how to get a job and continue advancing your career, what the most important skills are to foster, and lots of other valuable advice. The talk really got me thinking and I&rsquo;m really glad that I went. One piece of wisdom that he shared was that even when you are just starting out, there is always someone lower on the totem pole then you; the person who is in the place that you just were, running into the problems you just learned how to solve. And so its worthwhile to write and share your perspective about what you are doing even when you are starting out, because it can always be helpful to somebody. He also pointed out that oftentimes the people who can be most helpful to you are the people who most recently confronted the problems you are dealing with, because they will be best able to articulate what helped them understand it since it is still fresh in their minds. Oftentimes people who are extremely experienced are terrible at explaining things to newbies because its so deeply ingrained that it just feels intuitive, and it feels trivial to explain for them.</p>

<p>So here I am. Even though I&rsquo;ve been programming for years now, I still feel like I know nothing; I still have a pretty strong case of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome">imposter syndrome</a>. But when I take the time to reflect on everything I&rsquo;ve learned and all the projects I&rsquo;ve done, I realize they don&rsquo;t feel insignificant anymore. I&rsquo;m sitting here trying to write something about the things I&rsquo;ve done and it doesn&rsquo;t fit cleanly in once sentence like it used to.</p>

<p>So I&rsquo;d like to share some of my reflections on how I learned to program and give some general advice to people who are just starting out, or people who are just starting to feel comfortable with a language but don&rsquo;t have many significant projects under their belt yet. If you fit that description, I think this could be genuinely helpful to you.</p>

<h1 id="the-time-you-spend-struggling-is-the-most-valuable">The Time You Spend Struggling is the Most Valuable</h1>

<p>I think one of the most important things to understand as a beginner, that can be the most difficult to grasp, is the target that you are aiming at; what you should be striving towards when you practice in your classes and your personal projects. When you&rsquo;re starting out, and maybe especially if you are in some sort of college class or program, you will focus almost entirely on learning the syntax of your first language. That&rsquo;s fine. That&rsquo;s the right place to start. However I think a big trap that&rsquo;s easy to fall into when you are starting out is to put the content that you are learning before the process. When you are struggling with the basics and getting frustrated because you feel like you can&rsquo;t get even the simplest things to work, it can be tempting to constantly defer back to other people for help. You might be somewhere in a computer lab, waiting for a TA or a whiz kid to come around and help you with your problem. After all, you&rsquo;ll probably get out of there faster if you let them take a look at it&hellip;</p>

<p>But the thing is, you&rsquo;re not really there to learn Java / Python / C# / Javascript / whatever language you are learning. The odds that you will end up using the first language you learn in your job aren&rsquo;t that high, and even if you do, you will probably have to use other languages and technologies as well. The time you spend struggling in the dark is the most important time, because that is really what you will bring to the table when you go looking for a job. Nobody is looking for someone who knows Java / Javascript / C# / whatever, people are looking for someone who can help them create something, who can help them make their idea a reality. That almost always involves learning something that you don&rsquo;t know yet. If you&rsquo;re honest with yourself, you don&rsquo;t really care about the language that you&rsquo;re learning. You probably didn&rsquo;t even know it existed until someone else told you to learn it.</p>

<p>What you probably want is to be able to make cool things, or solve interesting problems. There is no book or manual that can tell you how to make everything. The only process that is core to making anything is this:</p>

<ol>
<li>Decide what you want to do / create.</li>
<li>Research and learn until you get an idea of how to approach the problem.</li>
<li>Do it until its done.</li>
</ol>

<p>It&rsquo;s so obvious and yet its so easy to lose sight of in the big, complicated, jargon heavy world of programming. These rules will help guide you through all of the trendy, flashy software and buzzwords that are thrown around; it&rsquo;s great to learn new things but you certainly wont have time to learn everything. All technologies are a tool; learn the ones that help you make the things you want to make more efficiently.</p>

<p>Do yourself a favor and struggle as much as you can. Pick things you have no idea how to do and try to do them. You will inevitably fail at some of them but in the process you will become more familiar with what you don&rsquo;t know, which will give you new ideas of what to study and learn. If you are someone who is self studying and learning on their own, this is the primary advantage that you have over others. It&rsquo;s ok to do some guided projects and courses to get your feet wet, but absolutely the bulk of your time should be dedicated to doing unguided work, because that is how you will learn to learn. The main disadvantage you have as a self-starter is that you lack immediate access to the wisdom of people more experienced than yourself. But you can absolutely make up for this by being proactive and seeking this yourself. And that leads into my next point&hellip;</p>

<h1 id="seek-out-experienced-people-and-use-them-to-build-your-roadmap">Seek out Experienced People and Use Them to Build Your Roadmap</h1>

<p>The previous section might make it seem like I advocating locking yourself in a room and not coming out until you are an amazing programmer, which is far from the truth. That is kind of what I did, and while there are elements of it which I think were extremely valuable as described above, I wish I had been less shy and went out of my way to talk to people who knew more than me.</p>

<p>I spent a lot of time paralyzed, not knowing what I should learn or focus on next, because you just can&rsquo;t know what you don&rsquo;t know. Half the battle is knowing what words you need to type into the search bar, because if you can&rsquo;t even get that far, you can&rsquo;t begin to progress. That is the kind of &lsquo;struggling in the dark&rsquo; that I do not advocate for; having no idea where to direct your energy is fundamentally unproductive, and it can also be psychologically harmful.</p>

<p>I had tons of people that I could have reached out to at any time for advice. I could have even gone online and sought help from strangers and probably gotten some decent advice. But I often spent time wallowing in my directionless-ness, not writing code for weeks or months because I didn&rsquo;t have something that interested me at the time.</p>

<p>The time that will be most enjoyable for you as a programmer will be when you are working on things that are genuinely interesting to you and you feel compelled to solve the problem. But sometimes you just won&rsquo;t get that feeling about a particular topic, or it will take a while for a feeling of excitement to set in. This is when your roadmap is most important. Having a wider view of <em>why</em> you are learning the things your are learning, and how what you are learning will help you reach the goals you <em>do</em> care about achieving, is what will help you keep working through those ruts where you don&rsquo;t feel inspired. It&rsquo;s not fun to do things you suck at. But its so satisfying to do something you are great at, and to keep improving.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t waste the time of an experienced person by asking them random questions that you could be posting on stack overflow or just googling yourself. If you&rsquo;ve done that before, you&rsquo;ve probably seen a look of annoyance or frustration on their face, and maybe thought they didn&rsquo;t want to help. But I think you&rsquo;d be surprised that people are more than willing to help you help yourself, and to point you in the right direction. The questions you ask should be of a broader nature like, if I want to create this kind of software, what technologies should I be trying to learn? What are core concepts that you think I should focus on or things that I&rsquo;ll likely run into if this is what I want to do? These are the kinds of things where it can be impossible to google since you don&rsquo;t know any of the jargon in an area you don&rsquo;t know the existence of, and often times these questions are less about specific information and more about personal insight and opinion.</p>

<h1 id="have-fun-and-take-care-of-yourself">Have Fun, and Take Care of Yourself</h1>

<p>To me, one of the hardest questions in life is what amount of importance to place on ephemeral things like pleasure and beauty, what amount of importance to place on personal progression and skill building, and what amount of importance to place on your values and what you find important.</p>

<p>Like a lot of things worth doing, programming is hard. Hopefully you can find ways to make it enjoyable when you are starting out and you find the problems that you are solving engaging. But sometimes you will hit barriers where you just don&rsquo;t feel like it, and you will just have to power through.</p>

<p>But there&rsquo;s only so much &lsquo;powering through&rsquo; that a person can do before they get burned out. You have to take care of yourself. People have limitations, and as a human being you have to accept that those limitations are more than just the amount of time you have in a day. You might not be making progress at the pace you would like, you might not be reaching your goal in the amount of time that you wish that you could. In fact, this is very rarely the case. What you thought might be a journey of weeks or months might turn out to be one of years. It is up to you to decide whether it is worth it for you.</p>

<p>The truth is that you will sometimes be forced into situations where you will have to burn yourself out to get things done on time. This is sometimes alright. But you have to keep in mind that you have an emotional relationship with activities; if you push yourself to an emotional breaking point constantly while doing something, you will eventually learn to hate that thing, because you will have many negative moments of your life associated with it. You will be training yourself to hate something that you want to enjoy.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re all simple animals in this way. We respond to positive and negative reinforcement and past a certain point, we can&rsquo;t help it. Self control and discipline can only take you so far in taming yourself. If you make it too unpleasant, you will find yourself with a dog that just can&rsquo;t bring itself to do the trick no matter how many treats you put in front of it, and that dog will be yourself. It&rsquo;ll take a lot of effort just to ease yourself back into things at that point, and that is not a place you want to be.</p>

<p>Work hard. Enjoy your work as much as you can. A feeling of growth and striving towards getting better is part of a healthy emotional life. Ulitimately you will be at your best when the effort you put in is feeding that sense of growth and purpose. But you&rsquo;re taking it to too far if there are other emotional needs that end up getting neglected.</p>

<p>Welp, that&rsquo;s all I&rsquo;ve got for now. Hopefully you found this valuable. If you&rsquo;d like to talk about programming or life, feel free to leave a comment. I&rsquo;m always happy to talk.</p>
