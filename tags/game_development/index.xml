      <description>Now to the good stuff. Redirecting from one piece of dialogue to the next is the bread and butter of most stories in games, and at the end of the day much of what you write will end up will likely be linear in nature; however, what makes games unique in terms of story telling is the ability to add interactivity, to create an experience that changes based on user input.</description>

      <description>In the last section, we got familiar with the problem and laid out what we&amp;rsquo;re trying to do; we talked about text nodes and how they store the dialogue, and either information about how to transition to the next node, or information about the choices to present the user with.
Now, let&amp;rsquo;s get into writing the code to work on that file. To start we are going to focus on writing the code that iterates over the file, and then we will create the GUI with buttons and text afterwards.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this series I&amp;rsquo;m going to go over creating a Javascript program that iterates over JSON to tell an interactive story.&lt;/p&gt;
